            <p id="deskCard" >Earlier this month, Armin Ronacher, a prominent open-source developer, was experimenting with a new code-generating tool from GitHub called Copilot when it began to produce a curiously familiar stretch of code.

              or even with access to the outside but restricted by IP (Security Group). Jump servers are often used to connect to a database, perform tests, 
              check application logs, apply updates.</p>
